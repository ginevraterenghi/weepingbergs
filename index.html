Differently from the others, people do not know anything about the Ice situation, because it is far away from their daily life, but it is still something serious that could change their lives in a direct way. This argument is about the thaw real effects. I  also decided to go deep in this topic for another reason: it is something less realistic but dangerous at the same time. It is related to the Iceberg physical appearence and to the Climate Change aesthetic consequences. Everybody thinks of the Climate Change in a tangible way, as it is right to be, because the impact is something really dramatic. We have also to consider the Climate Change is destroying the Earth beauty. Could beauty survive the Climate Change? I chose this topic because I feel in the melting ice a melancholic effect expressing both the serious consequences of the problem and the beauty destruction operated by the Climate Change.
